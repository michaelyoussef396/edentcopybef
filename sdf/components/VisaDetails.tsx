      <p>
        The Skilled Work Regional Visa Subclass 491 was introduced by the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) on 16th November, 2019, replacing the previous visa Subclass 489. This visa allows skilled workers to live and work in a designated regional area of Australia for up to 5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        State/Territory nomination for this visa provides you with 15 additional points to help meet the Department of Home Affairs points test pass mark of 65 points.
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone is nominated by the State or Territory Government for this visa, s/he must live in that State/Territory for the period of the entire visa. S/He will be able to lodge a Subclass 191 Visa application if s/he has lived and worked in a regional area for three years and should have minimum salary of $53,900 per annum. Once a permanent residence visa is granted, s/he can live anywhere in Australia. You cannot start living anywhere in Australia before Subclass 191 Visa is granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        If s/he wish to apply for this SC 491 visa, s/he must first obtain a positive skills assessment from his/her nominated occupation, and then lodge an Expression of Interest &amp; State or Territory nomination application. If this is successful, s/he will be invited to lodge a visa application.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">HOW DO I APPLY FOR A SUBCLASS 190 VISA?</h2>
      <p>Anyone who wishes to apply for this visa MUST first be INVITED to lodge an application by the Department of Immigration. In order to qualify for an invitation, you must lodge an &apos;Expression of Interest&apos; (EOI), which sets out how you meet the requirements for this visa.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">STAGE 1: INITIAL ELIGIBILITY:</h2>
      <p>The first step that we will take is to conduct an initial assessment of your eligibility for this visa. This involves reviewing your qualifications, work experience, English language and other circumstances, to establish whether or not you are likely to meet the relevant requirements.</p>
      <p>As part of this initial eligibility assessment, we will consider which MLTSSL occupation(s) you are likely to be able to nominate, and whether or not you are potentially eligible for a positive skills assessment from the relevant assessing authority for that occupation.</p>
      <p>We will then provide you with informed and comprehensive advice about your ability to meet the minimum standards that the Department of Immigration requires migrants to fulfill, in order to qualify for an invitation to apply for this visa.</p>
      <p>Note: Our initial assessment of your eligibility does not guarantee that you will (or will not) in fact obtain a positive skills assessment, or be issued an invitation to apply for this visa. In particular, whether or not the Department of Immigration issues you with an invitation will depend upon how your points test score compares to the scores of other potential applicants, and whether or not the Department of Immigration deems your nominated occupation to be required in Australia.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">STAGE 2: SKILLS ASSESSMENT</h2>
      <p>Should our initial assessment indicate that you are eligible for a positive skills assessment and EOI, we will prepare your skills assessment application.</p>
      <p>For each skilled occupation listed on the MLTSSL, the Department of Immigration has specified an assessing authority that may carry out skills assessments for that occupation. Only a skills assessment conducted by the relevant assessing authority will be accepted by the Department of Immigration in support of an EOI. We will provide you with a full list of the information and documents required to support your application. When you have provided the necessary details and documents, along with the required assessment fee, we will lodge your application with the applicable skills assessing authority.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">STAGE 3: EXPRESSION OF INTEREST (EOI)</h2>
      <p>Once you have received a positive skills assessment from the skills assessing authority, we will prepare and lodge your EOI. Although you do not need to provide supporting documents at this stage, you MUST be able to provide evidence that the information supplied in the EOI is correct at the time that you are invited to apply for the visa.</p>
      <p>You will subsequently receive a result and points score from the Department of Immigration, which is used to rank you against other applicants who have lodged EOIs for this visa. The ranking is based partially on whether or not your occupation is a skill that Australia requires at the time your EOI is assessed. If your EOI is successful, you will be invited to lodge a visa application.</p>
      <p>Note: The Department of Immigration retains an EOI for 2 years from the date that it is lodged. During this time, your EOI can be updated if any of your circumstances change (e.g. you obtain a new qualification or skills assessment). If your ranking changes during this 2-year period, based on either your changing circumstances or Australia&apos;s changing skill needs, you may be issued with an invitation to apply for the visa at that point in time.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">STAGE 4: VISA APPLICATION</h2>
      <p>Once the Department of Immigration has invited you to apply for this visa, we will prepare and lodge your visa application within the specified time frame, together with all of the documents that support the information that you provided in your EOI. This includes your skills assessment, English language test results, qualifications, work references and all other required documents. Should your visa application be approved, you will be granted a permanent visa. You may be either in Australia or overseas when your visa is granted.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">OTHER REQUIREMENTS</h2>

      <p>Police Certificate is valid for 12 months for the immigration purpose. If you have a substantial criminal record, you cannot pass the character test. For example, You have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison.</p>
